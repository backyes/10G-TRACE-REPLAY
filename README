Based on IOEngine from PacketShader, send packets from a specified trace file at speed of 10Gbps
Make some modification in the driver to adapt to current kernel version(2.6.37)

Improvements:

 * improvements
 * (1) send packets at the same time for all queueus.
 * (2) never discard any packets for specified traces
 * (3) allow loop or once-trace-replay as you wish.
 * (4) use pthread lib to rewrite it for supporting fine grained sysnc.
 * optimization on performance
 * (5) fix bugs on spin_lock_bh spothot(>80% overhead on cpu cycle).
 * (6) supports on numa lib, allocate memory after numa bind.
 * (7) do sync. among all threads with pthread lib instead of "fork", so rewrite most data structure for per-thread variable.

Improments:
/* Author: Yanfei Wang, <backyes@gmail.com>
 *	(1) usleep(n) to avoid small chunk size cause by sending remained packets for keeping "non-discard replay " manner..
 * (2) performance test 
 *	fix.mill-->split0.pcap split1.pcap ...(total 8 sub-traces)
 *	average packet size: ~90B (non-64Byte)
 *	Performance: 7.9Gbps(L2 payload), 10.4Mpps...
 * (3) Conclusion:
 *	it can replay trace at the speed of approximately line-rate...

NOTICE:

driver/Makefile  	-- Set "KSRC" to the kernel dir
interface name	 	-- IOEngine uses ixg%d, while our machine uses eth%d, can be modified in driver/install.py
sample/tx/tx.c    -- BATCH_SIZE, adjust to reduce system call overhead

USAGE:

Each TX thread uses a trace file, specify them in sample/tx/pktbuf.c : char fname[QUEUE_NUM][256];

./configure
Make
./install.py [# of RX queue] [# of TX queue]
./sample/tx/rep_trace [loop] xge# /* loop indicate replay trace in loop way. */
